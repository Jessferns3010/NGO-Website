          <h3>MEDICAL TREATMENT</h3>
          <p>Medical treatments for animals are an important aspect of animal welfare and can help to improve the health 
            and well-being of pets, farm animals, and wildlife. These treatments may include medications, surgeries, and other

          <h3>RESCUE INJURED AND OLD STRAY ANIMALS</h3>
          <p>Rescuing injured and old stray animals is an important part of animal welfare. Stray animals, especially those who are 
            old or injured, often struggle to survive on their own, facing hunger, exposure to the elements, and the risk of injury or illness. 
            By rescuing these animals and providing
             them with the care they need, we can help to improve their quality of life and give them a second chance at happiness.

          <h3>ADOPTION AND AWARENESS</h3>
          <p>Adoption is the process of taking in a homeless or abandoned animal as a new pet. Adopting a pet not only provides a loving home for an 
            animal in need, but it also helps to reduce the number of homeless animals in shelters and on the streets.<BR>
            Awareness is also key to improving animal welfare. By educating the public about the needs and rights of animals, 
            we can help to reduce animal cruelty and neglect, promote responsible pet ownership, and encourage others to take action to support 
            animal welfare causes
