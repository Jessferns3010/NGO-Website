        <p>Saving nature is at the very heart of what we do as WWF. For 60 years, we have made it our mission to find solutions that save the marvelous array of life on our planet by applying the best science available and working closely with local communities. And the impacts will reach far beyond the potential cultural loss of iconic species like tigers, rhinos, and whales.
              
            The good news is we’ve also seen what’s working. WWF has been part of successful wildlife recovery stories ranging from southern Africa’s black rhino to black bucks in the Himalayas. And this, in turn, is helping to protect rich and varied ecosystems while ensuring people continue to benefit from nature.
            
            This much is clear: we cannot afford to fail in our mission to save a living planet.</p>
